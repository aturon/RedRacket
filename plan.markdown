## Long-term vision

Milestone 1:

 - languages as libraries 
 - algorithmic advances

Milestone 2:

 - parallelism story
 
Milestone 3:

 - extending derivatives to extended REs (sub-matching, lookback/ahead)
 - complete replacement for Racket C code
 
## Immediate goals

1. Audit, organize code

   - introduce structs
   - remove "series" code
   - introduce brute-force search
   - move to typed racket
   - use for/list
   - pull out test cases we know can be handled

2. Finish front end work (support full grammar, delegate as needed)
3. See what happens with Racket test suite, both for correctness and performance
