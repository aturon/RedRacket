## Long-term vision

Milestone 1:

 - languages as libraries 
 - algorithmic advances

Milestone 2:

 - parallelism story
 
Milestone 3:

 - extending derivatives to extended REs (sub-matching, lookback/ahead)
 - complete replacement for Racket C code
 
## Immediate goals

1. Audit, organize code
2. Finish front end work (support full grammar, delegate as needed)
3. See what happens with Racket test suite, both for correctness and performance
